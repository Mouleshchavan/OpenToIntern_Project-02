# Project_02
Open to Intern Project Requirement
Key points
Create a group database groupXDatabase. You can clean the db you previously used and resue that.
This time each group should have a single git branch. Coordinate amongst yourselves by ensuring every next person pulls the code last pushed by a team mate. You branch will be checked as part of the demo. Branch name should follow the naming convention project/internshipGroupX
Follow the naming conventions exactly as instructed. The backend code will be integrated with the front-end application which means any mismatch in the expected request body will lead to failure in successful integration.
